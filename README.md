# MyLeetCodeSolutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty and problem number. Each solution is implemented in C.

> **Note:** The code files in this repository provide only the solution functions for LeetCode problems. They are not complete, runnable programs and do not include a `main` function or input/output handling. To run them, you need to write your own test harness or integrate them into a complete C program.

## Directory Structure

- `Easy/` - Solutions to easy-level problems
- `Medium/` - Solutions to medium-level problems

## Code List

A complete list of all solution codes can be found in the [`CODES_LIST.md`](./CODES_LIST.md) file. This file is updated as new solutions are added.

## File Naming Convention

Each solution file is named as follows:

```
<problem_number><problem_name><file_extension>
```

For example:
- `0001TwoSum.c` (Easy)
- `0167TwoSum2.c` (Medium)

## How to Use

1. Browse the `Easy/` and `Medium/` directories for solutions.
2. Open any `.c` file to view the code for that problem.

- This repository is for educational purposes and personal reference.
